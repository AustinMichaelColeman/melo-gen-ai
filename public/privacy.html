      <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes the type of personal information we
          collect from users ("Users", "you", "your") of our MeloGenAI plugin
          (the "Plugin") for ChatGPT and for YouTube Music™, how we use, share
          and protect this information. This API Client uses YouTube API
          Services. See the
          <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy"
            >Google Privacy Policy</a
          >. This is a plugin for ChatGPT, created by OpenAI. See the
          <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy"
            >OpenAI privacy policy.</a
          >
          This plugin is hosted using Vercel. See the

        <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
        <p>When using the Plugin, we collect the following information:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Your YouTube account details for the purposes of generating
            playlists for YouTube Music™
          </li>
          <li>
            The title submitted to ChatGPT for the playlist being generated
          </li>
          <li>
            The names of songs you want to query YouTube for playlist generation
          </li>
          <li>
            The privacy setting you choose for your playlist. If none is
            specified, it will default to public.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We don't collect any information beyond what's necessary for the
          Plugin to function.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Information Use</h2>
        <p>
          We use your information only for the context of the Plugin's
          functionality and not for any other purposes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We do not retain any personal data collected through the Plugin. All
          data is used solely for the purpose of generating the playlist and is
          not stored. While we do not store any data, the third-party services
          (YouTube, OpenAI, and Vercel) may have their own data retention
          policies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding
          your personal data. These may include the right to access your data,
          the right to correct inaccurate data, and the right to request
          deletion of your data. As we do not retain any personal data, these
          rights may not be applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can revoke the Plugin's access to your data via the
          <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions"
            >Google security settings page</a

      <section>
        <h2>6. Public Playlists</h2>
        <p>
          Please note that the playlists generated by the Plugin will be public
          by default and associated with your YouTube Music™ account. You can
          request the plugin generate the playlist either as public, private, or
          unlisted. The plugin instructs ChatGPT to provide you with the list of
          songs we plan to add to the playlist and the name of the playlist
          prior to creation. The plugin is instructed to ask your consent prior
          to actually generating the playlist.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties,
          unless it's necessary for the Plugin's functionality or if we are
          legally required to do so.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information.
          However, we cannot guarantee absolute security as no method of online
          transmission or storage is 100% secure.

      <section>
        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>

          do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
          If we become aware that a child under 13 has interacted with our
          Plugin, we will inform the relevant parties to cease the use of such
          information.
