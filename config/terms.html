      <p>Updated May 30, 2023</p>
      <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          These terms of use ("Terms") govern your use of the MeloGenAI plugin
          ("Plugin") created by Austin Coleman ("We", "Us", "Our"). This Plugin
          is designed for OpenAI's ChatGPT and for YouTube Music. By using this
          Plugin, you are agreeing to these Terms. In addition, by using this
          API Client, you ("User") are agreeing to be bound by the
          <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use"
            >OpenAI terms of use</a
          >, OpenAI's ChatGPT

        <h2>2. Description of the Plugin</h2>
        <p>
          The Plugin is designed to generate playlists for the user on YouTube
          Music based on a list of search queries provided by the user. The
          plugin is intended to inform the user that the YouTube playlist
          generated will be associated with their YouTube account. The Plugin
          aims to provide the user with a list of the songs it plans to search
          youtube for in order to generate a playlist, the playlist name it
          plans to use, and seeks express consent from the user prior to
          execution.
        </p>

        <p>
          By installing and using this Plugin, the user agrees to allow the
          Plugin to generate playlists on their YouTube Music account.
          Instructions are given to ChatGPT to ask consent, but we do not have
          control over whether ChatGPT will comply with the instructions we have
          given it. We have designed the plugin to the best of our ability to
          require user consent prior to generating the playlist. While the
          Plugin is designed to seek express consent prior to generating a
          playlist, in the event that it does not, the user understands and
          agrees that consent is implied by the act of installing and using the
          Plugin. At any point you can revoke the plugin's ability to create
          playlists by revoking access at your
          <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions"
