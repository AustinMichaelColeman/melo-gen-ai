      <p>Updated June 1, 2023</p>
      <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          These terms of use ("Terms") govern your use of the MeloGenAI plugin
          ("Plugin") created by Austin Coleman ("We", "Us", "Our"). This Plugin
          is designed for OpenAI's ChatGPT and for YouTube Music. The Plugin is
          an open-source project and its code can be accessed and contributed to
          on GitHub. By using this Plugin, you ("the user") are agreeing to
          these Terms. In addition, by using this API Client, you are agreeing
          to be bound by the
          <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use"
            >OpenAI terms of use</a
          >, OpenAI's ChatGPT
          <a href="https://openai.com/policies/plugin-terms">Plugin terms</a>
          and Google's
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service"
            >YouTube Terms of Service</a

        <h2>2. Description of the Plugin</h2>
        <p>
          The Plugin is designed to generate playlists for the user on YouTube
          Music. The plugin requires a playlist title and a list of search
          queries and optionally a privacy setting that defaults to public. The
          plugin instructs the ChatGPT model to "Help the user generate a
          playlist for YouTube Music."
        </p>

        <p>
          By installing and enabling this Plugin, the user agrees to allow the
          Plugin to generate playlists on their YouTube Music account. Note that
          since YouTube and YouTube Music use the same data, the playlists are
          also associated with your YouTube account. If you do not want the
          plugin to generate playlists on your account, you can uninstall the
          plugin or disable the plugin in ChatGPT. In addition to uninstalling,
          the user can also revoke the plugin's access to their account at their
          <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions"
            >Google security settings page</a
          >.

          ensure that any content you provide for playlist creation does not
          violate any laws, rules, or regulations, and does not infringe upon
          the rights of any third party. You represent and warrant that you have
          all necessary rights to use the content in the manner described by
          these Terms. You agree to be bound by the

          understand that your playlists will be made public by default and
          associated with your YouTube account. When interacting with the
          plugin, you can request it generate the playlist as public, private,
          or unlisted. Note that this plugin is designed to only generate new
          playlists. If you'd like to delete or modify the playlists this plugin
          generates, you can do that at the
